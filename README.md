# TestVagrant Coding Assignment

Create an in-memory store for recently played songs that can accommodate N songs per user, with a fixed initial capacity. This store must have the capability to store a list of song-user pairs, with each song linked to a user. It should also be able to fetch recently played songs based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.
